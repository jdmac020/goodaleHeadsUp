# goodaleHeadsUp
Sometimes the garage is a mess. Other times it is not. A heads-up would be nice.

## As a Forge resident,

I want to know the **likelihood of unusually conjested** conditions at the Goodale Garage **before I leave home**,

So that I can either *brace myself* for shenanigans or *create an alternate game plan*.

## As a random side project,

We want to **raise the possibility** of a hot mess at the Goodale Ave parking garage **prior to the average Forge resident starting their commute**,

So that we can contribute to high employee delight among our peers through lowering frustration levels associated with parking through *adjusted expectations* and/or *altered commute times*.

## As a contributer to a random side project,

I want to provide value **using technologies I do not typically have an opportunity to work in**,

So that I can *broaden my technical acumen* on an exercise that *feels more valuable than tutorials*.
